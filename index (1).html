    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
        Here are two exercises demonstrating my knowledge of using functions in Javascript.
        The first exercise is a simple function to calculate degrees fahrenheit given the value celcius.
        I set the function name as fahrenheit, the paramenter as celcius, and in the console, wrote the formula to calculate fahrenheit replacing the value of celcius with the name of the parameter.
        Then to call the function, I inputted three different arguements: 68, 75, and 95.
        To double check if the calculation was correct, I manually calculated the values on a calculator and got the same output. 
        
        The second exercise is split into two parts. 
        In the first part, I created a simple function to calculate the human age given a dog's age.
        The function would print: "Your dog is NN years old in human years!" with NN represented as the parameter dogAge.
        The conversion rate is 1 human year is 7 dog years.
        I set the function name as calculateDogAge, the parameter as dogAge, and the console to print in the following order:
        the string "Your doggie is ", calculation multply parameter dogAge by 7, and the string "years old in human years!".
        Then to call the function, I inputted three different arguements: 7, 3 and 10.

        In the second part, I decide to print the dog's name in the console.
        I created a function named calculateDogNameAge to calculate the human age given the dog's age and name.
        The first parameter dogNameAge is the name of the dog and the second parameter dogName is the name of the dog.
        The function would print: the string from the inputted dog's name, calculate the conversion from dog to human years given the inputted dog age, and the string "yeard old in huma years!"
        Then to call the function, I input two arguments, the dog's name and the dog's age.
        Ex. (7, "Bernice")
